abstract = {Can urban design improve the environment? If communities could be designed to reduce automobile use, then yes. But can urban design influence travel? Surprisingly perhaps, the effects of any specific neighborhood feature on travel behavior at the margin are all but unknown. The policy significance of this issue is reflected in the swelling popularity of the ‘new urbanism' and other planning strategies employing land use tools to mitigate the environmental impacts of metropolitan development. In addition to asserting that development patterns and densities affect how far, how often, and by what means people travel, urban designers frequently argue that the legibility and shape of the local street pattern play a key role. ‘Connected' residential blocks are thus associated with less driving by comparison with the circuitous routes of the modern suburban cul-de-sac—chiefly by reducing trip lengths and facilitating pedestrian and transit access. Remarkably, there is little empirical and theoretical support for these claims. This paper provides the first direct tests of these hypotheses within a consistent behavioral framework. An analysis of household travel diary and GIS data for San Diego finds little role for land use in explaining travel behavior, and no evidence that the street network pattern affects either short or long non-work travel decisions. While results may vary in other areas, the empirical argument for using land use as an element of regional air quality or other environmental plans remains to be demonstrated.},

abstract = {Mixing land uses has become one of the key planning principles of the Smart Growth movement and other land use planning strategies. This article analyzes the impact on the prices of single family houses when mixed land uses are included in neighborhoods. We first develop several quantitative measures of mixed land uses through the use of Geographic Information System (GIS) data and compute these measures for various neighborhoods in Washington County, OR. We then incorporate those measures in a hedonic price analysis. We conclude from this research that housing prices increase with their proximity to-or with increasing amount of-public parks or neighborhood commercial land uses. We also find, however, that housing prices are higher in neighborhoods dominated by single-family residential land use, where non-residential land uses were evenly distributed, and where more service jobs are available. Finally, we find that housing prices tended to fall with proximity to multi-family residential units. ?? 2004 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {There has been an increasing interest in the land use-transportation connection in the past decade, motivated by the possibility that design policies associated with the built environment can be used to control, manage, and shape individual traveler behavior and aggregate travel demand. In this line of research and application pursuit, it is critical to understand whether the empirically observed association between the built environment and travel behavior-related variables is a true reflection of underlying causality or simply a spurious correlation attributable to the intervening relationship between the built environment and the characteristics of people who choose to live in particular built environments. In this research paper, we identify the research designs and methodologies that may be used to test the presence of "true" causality versus residential sorting-based "spurious" associations in the land-use transportation connection. The paper then develops a methodological formulation to control for residential sorting effects in the analysis of the effect of built environment attributes on travel behavior-related choices. The formulation is applied to comprehensively examine the impact of the built environment, transportation network attributes, and demographic characteristics on residential choice and car ownership decisions. The model formulation takes the form of a joint mixed multinomial logit-ordered response structure that (a) accommodates differential sensitivity to the built environment and transportation network variables due to both demographic and unobserved household attributes and (b) controls for the self-selection of individuals into neighborhoods based on car ownership preferences stemming from both demographic characteristics and unobserved household factors. The analysis in the paper represents, to our knowledge, the first instance of the formulation and application of a unified mixed multinomial logit-ordered response structure in the econometric literature. The empirical analysis in the paper is based on the residential choice and car ownership decisions of San Francisco Bay area residents. ?? 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

The traditional subfield of spatial analysis is witnessing a major resurgence and enhancement due to GIS and geographical information science (GISci), an interdisciplinary field focusing on the theory and methodology underlying GIS software. The interdisciplinary field of geographic information systems for transportation (GIS-T) has emerged to focus on the role of GIS in transportaton analysis and planning. This paper suggests the benefits of closer linkages between spatial analysis, GISci, and transportation through a focused review of spatial analytical issues and their potential contributions to GIS-T. Specifically, this paper reviews the following issues: (i) modifiable areal units; (ii) boundary problems and spatial sampling; (iii) spatial dependence and spatial heterogeneity; and (iv) alternative representations of geographic environments. The discussion highlights the general issues as well as identifies their specific relevance to GIS-T. In addition, this paper identifies some emerging tools from GISci that can address these spatial analytical issues in GIS-T.},

abstract = {Four-step travel demand forecasting models were never meant to estimate the travel impacts of neighborhood-level smart growth initiatives like transit villages, but rather to guide regional highway and transit investments. While progress has been made in enhancing large-scale models, some analysts have turned to post-processing and direct models to reduce modeling time and cost, and to better capture the travel impacts of neighborhood-scale land use strategies. This paper presents examples of direct or off-line modeling of rail and transitoriented land use proposals for greater Charlotte, the San Francisco Bay Area exurbs, and south St. Louis County. These alternative approaches provided a useful platform for scenario testing, and their results revealed that concentrating development near rail stations produced an appreciable ridership bonus. These alternative models are appropriate as sketch-planning supplements to, not substitutes for, traditional four-step models.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVES: to establish reference values for both comfortable and maximum gait speed and to describe the reliability of the gait speed measures and the correlation of selected variables with them. DESIGN: descriptive and cross-sectional. METHODS: subjects were 230 healthy volunteers. Gait was timed over a 7.62 m expanse of floor. Actual and height normalized speed were determined. Lower extremity muscle strength was measured with a hand-held dynamometer. RESULTS: mean comfortable gait speed ranged from 127.2 cm/s for women in their seventies to 146.2 cm/s for men in their forties. Mean maximum gait speed ranged from 174.9 cm/s for women in their seventies to 253.3 cm/s for men in their twenties. Both gait speed measures were reliable (coefficients {\textgreater} or = 0.903) and correlated significantly with age (r {\textgreater} or = -0.210), height (r {\textgreater} or = 0.220) and the strengths of four measured lower extremity muscle actions (r = 0.190-0.500). The muscle action strengths most strongly correlated with gait speed were nondominant hip abduction (comfortable speed) and knee extension (maximum speed). CONCLUSIONS: these normative values should give clinicians a reference against which patient performance can be compared in a variety of settings. Gait speed can be expected to be reduced in individuals of greater age and of lesser height and lower extremity muscle strength.},

abstract = {The 0.5-mile distance has become accepted for gauging a transit station's catchment area in the United States and is the de facto standard for the planning of U.S. transit-oriented developments (TODs). Planners and researchers use transit catchment areas not only to make predictions about transit ridership and transit impacts (socioeconomic and on land use) but also to prescribe regulations (e.g., relaxing restrictive zoning or carving out TODs for financial plans). This radius is loosely based on the distance that people are willing to walk to transit, but the same reason- ing has been used to justify other transit catchment areas. Station-level variables from 1,449 high-capacity American transit stations in 21 cit- ies are used to determine whether a clear benchmark between distance and ridership provides a norm for station-area planning and prediction. Results indicate that, for the purposes of predicting station-level transit ridership, different catchment areas have little influence on a model's predictive power. This finding suggests that transit agencies should use the easiest, most readily available data when estimating direct demand models. The evidence is less clear for prescribing land use policy. Nev- ertheless, results support the use of a 0.25-mile catchment area around transit for jobs and a 0.5-mile catchment area for population. Even though these distances probably will vary, depending on the location and the study purpose, the distances are good starting points for consid- ering transit-oriented land use policy or collecting labor-intensive data, such as surveys, about transit-adjacent firms or households.

abstract = {Travelers can be classified into two groups: choice users and captive users. Choice users select transit or automobile service when they view one option as superior, whereas captive users have only one travel option. Surprisingly, little is known about captivity effects on mode split models. This research examines the way transit service factors such as accessibility and connectivity relate to mode captivity and mode choice. Data for this investigation come from the Portland, Oregon, 1994 Household Activity and Travel Diary Survey, the Regional Land Information System for the Portland area, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency fuel economy database, and the U.S. Department of Energy. Individual trip data were segmented into transit captive, automobile captive, and choice users based on information about private vehicle availability, transit connectivity, and distance from a transit stop. Traditional transit mode split models are compared with models that segment users into choice and captive groups. It was found that traditional models underestimate the variation in mode choice for captive users, while overestimating the attractiveness of transit for choice users. These results indicate that better transit forecasts can result if accessibility and connectivity are used to help identify captive users. Additionally, among choice transit users, differences in travel times between automobile and transit modes do little to influence mode selection, while walk access to transit has more effect than previously thought.},

The results show that the dense transit route network in the downtown area results in lower walk access distances than in other parts of the city. Also, dwelling type of the household, number of vehicles available in the household, and transit service frequency show a noteworthy relationship with access distance in Toronto. In general, it was found that around 60{\%} of transit users in Toronto live within the transit service area of 300 m airline distance assumed by the transit service provider. These results indicate that people in Toronto are willing to walk further to access transit than assumed existing standards for transit service areas.},

abstract = {The quality of transport networks does not only depend on the quality of the individual links and nodes, but also on the way these nodes and links function in the context of multimodal networks. In the present paper we focus on multimodal trips where the railways are the main transport mode. We discuss detour and frequency problems related to multimodal transport chains. Local accessibility of railway stations is an important determinant of railway use in the Netherlands. We find that the propensity to make use of rail services by people living in the ring between 500 to 1000 meters from a railway station is about 20{\%} lower than of people living at most 500 meters away from railway stations. At distances between 1.0 and 3.5 km the distance decay effect is about 30{\%}, and above this distance it may reach values up to 50{\%}. Non-motorized transport modes are dominant at both the home-end and the activity-end. A rather unique feature of the home-end access mode is the high share of the bicycle. More than one out of every three passengers uses the bike on the trip from home to station. At the activity-end the share of the bike is much smaller, because of the asymmetry in the supply of this transport mode in the home versus activity-end. This explains the dominant position of walking as the access mode at the activity-end. Implications are discussed for physical planning and the need for facilities near railway stations.},

We find that land use type, transit accessibility, income, and density are strongly significant and robust predictors of transit ridership for the statewide and urban areas datasets. We also find that the determinants and their coefficients vary across urban, suburban and rural areas. Next we used a suite of econometric, land use and other models to generate two sets of future transit ridership scenarios under conditions of - (a) business as usual and (b) high energy price - for a 30-year horizon. We analyze these scenarios to demonstrate the value of our approach for state-level decision-making. ?? 2012 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {Compact, mixed-use, and walk-friendly urban development, many contend, can significantly influence the modes people choose to travel. Despite a voluminous empirical literature, most past studies have failed to adequately specify relationships for purposes of drawing inferences about the importance of built-environment factors in shaping mode choice. This paper frames the study of mode choice in Montgomery County, Maryland around a normative model that weighs the influences of not only three core dimensions of built environments - density, diversity, and design - but factors related to generalized cost and socioeconomic attributes of travelers as well. The marginal contributions of built-environment factors to a traditionally specified utility-based model of mode choice are measured. The analysis reveals intensities and mixtures of land use significantly influence decisions to drive-alone, share a ride, or patronize transit, while the influences of urban design tend to be more modest. Elasticities that summarize relationships are also presented, and recommendations are offered on how outputs from conventional mode-choice models might be "post-processed" to better account for the impacts of built environments when testing land-use scenarios. {\textcopyright} 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd.

Direct ridership model was developed to explain the ridership at 55 Metro stations using a Geographic Information System (GIS) and multiple regression analysis. Independent variables included factors measuring land use, external connectivity, intermodal connection, and station context. Six variables were found to be significantly associated with Metro station ridership at the 0.05 level: population, business/office floor area, CBD dummy variable, number of education buildings, entertainment venues and shop centers. Five variables were proved to be related to station ridership at the 0.01 significance level: employment, road length, feeder bus lines, bicycle park-and-ride (P{\&}R) spaces, and transfer dummy variable. In particular, CBD dummy variable, the number of education buildings, entertainment venues and shop centers, and bicycle P{\&}R spaces were found to be significantly connected to Metro station ridership in the present study. The results not only confirm some findings from previous studies but also show distinct differences regarding some variables specific to the Chinese context. ?? 2013 Elsevier Ltd.},

The authors illustrate the distributional patterns and characteristics of planning factors such as transit supply service, land use, street network and urban design at each rail station area. To identify effects of TOD planning factors upon the transit ridership at the targeted 214 rail station areas in Seoul, the study develops multiple regression models for transit ridership, which are differentiated at the levels of time of day, day of the week, and transit mode at the respective rail station areas. The analysis results suggest that TOD planning factors can have a significant positive impact in forming a transit-oriented city. They also indicate that some TOD planning factors, compared to low-density cities in Western countries, need to be carefully applied towards Seoul in order to achieve the objective of regenerating a transit-oriented city. In summary, rather than focusing mainly on increasing development density, it is necessary to concentrate more on such strategies as strengthening the transit service network, increasing the land-use mix index, and restructuring the street networks and urban design to be more pedestrian friendly around rail stations. ?? 2010.},

Broward County has few land use attributes thought necessary for transit success. This (2000) study seeks to understand its performance despite its transit-unfriendly urban environment by estimating a transit ridership demand model that differs from most by including generalised price of transit travel from origin to destination. The hypothesis, which the study confirms, is that price (time to reach employment) is more important than land use variables for explaining transit patronage, at least for a bus-only transit system with a large number of transit-dependent riders. The results of this study give further empirical support to recent transit system initiatives to focus more service on decentralised employment centres using multidestination transit network structures.},

abstract = {The idea of using transit-oriented development (TOD) in reducing automobile dependency and improving the sustainability of transportation activities has gained wider support in recent years. Research findings have shown that residents living in TOD neighborhood used transit more frequently than people having similar socio-economic characteristics but living elsewhere. Most of the existing studies on TOD and transit ridership used recently developed sites or suburban neighborhoods as case studies. However, limited research studies have been conducted on TOD using city-wide station-level data. By using the heavy rail systems in New York City and Hong Kong as case studies, factors which are expected to contribute to higher rail transit ridership are analyzed by using multiple regressions. The results show that a combination of variables in different dimensions, including (i) land use, (ii) station characteristics, (iii) socio-economic and demographic characteristics and (iv) inter-modal competition were important in accounting for the variability of rail transit ridership. In particular, station characteristics appeared to be the most important dimension in affecting average weekday railway patronage. Future research on TOD may pay more attention on examining how various aspects of station characteristics can be modified to increase railway patronage. Besides, car ownership is both significant and positively associated with railway patronage. The result suggests that higher car ownership may be associated with more pick-ups, drop-offs and park-and-ride activities to the transit stations for the longer transit trip legs. Furthermore, this study shows that place-specific factors are important in influencing railway patronage.},

A large array of potential transit use predictors were considered, including demographic, socioeconomic, land use, transit supply quality, and pedestrian environment variables. The best predictors identified through model estimation include two global variables, regional accessibility to employment and percentage of households with no car, and three local variables, employment density, average number of cars in households with children, and percentage of Black population. The models were estimated based on 2000 CTPP data for Broward County. Model testing showed significant improvement in model accuracy. The GWR models indicate that for local variables, their significance and influence vary by location. It is also observed that for this particular problem, an unexpected local sign of a variable is an indication of the insignificance or irrelevance of the variable at that location. This understanding of where a variable is significant and how significant it is at different locations is useful because it provides a basis for the development of transit service improvements by determining where improvements are needed and how much benefit the improvements will bring. The findings indicate that the local model estimation technique of GWR can help improve transit demand analysis and the identification of priority areas where transit service may need improvements.},

These factors were examined in the Seoul metropolitan area, which is one of the most densely populated regions in the world. A regression analysis was conducted with weekly average of station boardings as the dependent variable. Twenty-four independent variables were chosen based on insights and findings from previous studies. They were categorized into three groups: built environment, external connectivity, and intermodal connection. Seven variables proved to be significantly associated with station boardings: employment, commercial floor area, office floor area, net population density, number of transfers, number of feeder bus lines, and a dummy variable indicating transfer stations. Furthermore, in order to identify indirect or cyclic relationships among variables in generating station boardings, which cannot be accounted for in regression analysis, a structural equation model (SEM) was adopted. Prior to the model identification, a conceptual framework was hypothesized. After testing a number of candidate SEMs within the framework, the final SEM was established. All links in the final model were statistically significant. Several links represented cyclic relationships between variables. As a result, some variables that were insignificant in the regression analysis were included in the final SEM. Variables in the external connectivity group were found to be associated with station boardings, and variables for land use and walkability proved to be indirectly related to station boardings through employment. In particular, the number of feeder bus lines was found to have a reciprocal relationship with station boardings. Several separate links represented a cyclic relationship between external connectivity and intermodal connection. ?? 2010 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {As the number of private vehicles grows worldwide, so does air pollution and traffic congestion, which typically constrain economic development. To achieve transportation sustainability and continued economic development, the dependency on private vehicles must be decreased by increasing public transportation usage. However, without knowing the key factors that affect public transportation usage, developing strategies that effectively improve public transportation usage is impossible. Therefore, this study respectively applies global and local regression models to identify the key factors of usage rates for 348 regions (township or districts) in Taiwan. The global regression model, the Tobit regression model (TRM), is used to estimate one set of parameters that are associated with explanatory variables and explain regional differences in usage rates, while the local regression model, geographically weighted regression (GWR), estimates parameters differently depending on spatial correlations among neighbouring regions. By referencing related studies, 32 potential explanatory variables in four categories, social-economic, land use, public transportation, and private transportation, are chosen. Model performance is compared in terms of mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) and spatial autocorrelation coefficient (Moran' I). Estimation results show that the GWR model has better prediction accuracy and better accommodation of spatial autocorrelation. Seven variables are significantly tested, and most have parameters that differ across regions in Taiwan. Based on these findings, strategies are proposed that improve public transportation usage.},

abstract = {Public subsidy of transit services has increased dramatically in recent years, with little effect on overall ridership. Quite obviously, a clear understanding of the factors influencing transit ridership is central to decisions on investments in and the pricing and deployment of transit services. Yet the literature about the causes of transit use is quite spotty; most previous aggregate analyses of transit ridership have examined just one or a few systems, have not included many of the external, control variables thought to influence transit use, and have not addressed the simultaneous relationship between transit service supply and consumption. This study addresses each of these shortcomings by (1) conducting a cross-sectional analysis of transit use in 265 US urbanized areas, (2) testing dozens of variables measuring regional geography, metropolitan economy, population characteristics, auto/highway system characteristics, and transit system characteristics, and (3) constructing two-stage simultaneous equation regression models to account for simultaneity between transit service supply and consumption. We find that most of the variation in transit ridership among urbanized areas - in both absolute and relative terms - can be explained by factors outside of the control of public transit systems: (1) regional geography (specifically, area of urbanization, population, population density, and regional location in the US), (2) metropolitan economy (specifically, personal/household income), (3) population characteristics (specifically, the percent college students, recent immigrants, and Democratic voters in the population), and (4) auto/highway system characteristics (specifically, the percent carless households and non-transit/non-SOV trips, including commuting via carpools, walking, biking, etc.). While these external factors clearly go a long way toward determining the overall level of transit use in an urbanized area, we find that transit policies do make a significant difference. The observed range in both fares and service frequency in our sample could account for at least a doubling (or halving) of transit use in a given urbanized area. Controlling for the fact that public transit use is strongly correlated with urbanized area size, about 26{\%} of the observed variance in per capita transit patronage across US urbanized areas is explained in the models presented here by service frequency and fare levels. The observed influence of these two factors is consistent with both the literature and intuition: frequent service draws passengers, and high fares drive them away. ?? 2008 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {This study has dual research objectives: 1) to evaluate the land use characteristics of the pedestrian catchment areas (PCA) of subway stations in the Seoul metropolitan area (SMA) in terms of transit-oriented development (TOD) principles and 2) to investigate the influence of each PCA's land use characteristics on station-level ridership. The major findings can be summarized as follows. First, the built environments of subway PCAs in Seoul were found to be compatible with TOD principles in terms of density and diversity. They have declining density gradients of population and employment that extend outward from a station and have a high level of mixed-use land.Second, population and employment densities, land use mix diversity, and intermodal connectivity all have a positive impact on subway ridership, but differ in their spatial ranges. In particular, the influence spans of residential and commercial development patterns (population density and the proportion of commercial land) and mixed land use on ridership were limited to only the core and primary PCAs. Consequently, with respect to TOD in a compact city like Seoul, we recommend that a PCA be defined to encompass a radius of 600 m.},

abstract = {Many US cities have recently built or approved light-rail systems to combat congestion, sprawl, and pollution. Critics questions light rail's ability to generate ridership in low-density, automobile-oriented, polycentric US cities with smaller downtowns. Proponents counter that sufficient numbers of homes and workplaces have convenient access to stations via walking, park-and-ride, or bus to develop feasible corridors connecting major residential areas with suburban concentrations of employment and the CBD. With this in mind, we used multiple regression to determine factors that contribute to higher light-rail ridership. Cross-sectional data on average weekday boardings were collected for the year 2000 for 268 stations in nine US cities representing a variety of urban settings. The results showed the importance of land use and accessibility. Employment, population, and percent renters within walking distance, as well as bus lines, park-and-ride spaces, and centrality, were significant. Dummy variables for terminal and transfer stations and international borders were all positive and significant. Total degree-days were negative and significant, lowering expectations for cities with extreme climates. Notably, the stations in the CBD generate much higher boardings, but these are explainable by the same variables present in lesser combinations at non-CBD stations and account for their generally lesser boardings. Importantly, a dummy variable for CBD location was not significant. The resulting model may be useful as a first-cut, one-step approach for predicting demand for possible light-rail alignments. ?? 2003 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {While most aggregate studies of transit ridership are conducted at either the stop or the route level, the present study focused on factors affecting Metro ridership in the Seoul metropolitan area at the station-to-station level. The station-to-station analysis made it possible to distinguish the effect of origin factors on Metro ridership from that of destination factors and to cut down the errors caused by the aggregation of travel impedance-related variables. After adopting two types of direct-demand patronage forecasting models, the multiplicative model and the Poisson regression model, the former was found to be superior to the latter because it clearly identified the negative influences of competing modes on Metro ridership. Such results are rarely found with aggregate level analyses. Moreover, the importance of built environment in explaining Metro demand was confirmed by separating built environment variables for origin and destination stations and by differentiating ridership by the time of day. For morning peak hours, the population-related variables of the origin stations played a key role in accounting for Metro ridership, while employment-related variables prevailed in destination stations. In evening peak hours, both employment- and population-related variables were significant in accounting for the Metro ridership at the destination station. This showed that a significant number of people in the Seoul metropolitan area appear to take various non-home-based trips after work, which is consistent with the results from direct household travel surveys. {\textcopyright} 2011 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.},

abstract = {A growing base of research adopts direct demand models to reveal associations between transit ridership and influence factors in recent years. This study is designed to investigate the factors affecting rail transit ridership at both station level and station-to-station level by adopting multiple regression model and multiplicative model respectively, specifically using an implemented Metro system in Nanjing, China, where Metro implementation is on the rise. Independent variables include factors measuring land-use mix, intermodal connection, station context, and travel impedance. Multiple regression model proves 11 variables are significantly associated with Metro ridership at station level: population, employment, business/office floor area, CBD dummy variable, number of major educational sites, entertainment venues and shopping centers, road length, feeder bus lines, bicycle park-and-ride (P{\&}R) spaces, and transfer dummy variable. Results from multiplicative model indicate that factors influencing Metro station ridership may also influence Metro station-to-station ridership, varied by both trip ends (origin/destination) and time of day. In comparison with previous case studies, CBD dummy variable and bicycle P{\&}R are statistically significant to explain Metro ridership in Nanjing. In addition, Metro travel impedance variables have significant influence on station-to-station ridership, representing the basic time-decay relationship in travel distribution. Potential implications of the model results include estimating Metro ridership at station level and station-to-station level by considering the significant variables, recognizing the necessity to establish a cooperative multi-modal transit system, and identifying opportunities for transit-oriented development. {\textcopyright} 2013 Springer Science+Business Media New York.},

abstract = {This report documents the development of a ridership model at the stop level for Transit Level of Service (TLOS), a software package of the Florida Department of Transportation (FDOT) for measuring transit availability and mobility. This report is in two separate parts. This first part discusses issues in formulating a ridership model on several aspects, including literature review, the study area, analytical framework, data needs, and model-formulation issues. For each issue, the discussion focuses on the alternative approaches to dealing with the issue, any resolution, and CUTR's recommendation, if different from the resolution. The second part discusses the data made available by Kittelson and Associates, Inc. under a separate contract with the FDOT, the data used for model estimation, and the selection of a final model. The final model relates average weekday boarding at a TLOS stop with six categories of factors: 1) socio-demographics in a catchment area; 2) TLOS value; 3) the street environment for pedestrians; 4) accessibility to population and employment; 5) interaction with other modes; and 6) competition with other TLOS stops. Despite some data limitations, the model fits the data well and behaves as expected.},

abstract = {In this study, we employ spatial regression analysis to empirically investigate the impacts of land use, rail service coverage, and rail station accessibility on rail transit ridership in the city of Seoul and the surrounding metropolitan region. Our analyses suggest that a rail transit service coverage boundary of 500m provides the best fit for estimating rail transit ridership levels. With regard to land use, our results confirm that density is positively related to rail transit ridership within a 750m radius of each station. In contrast, land use diversity is not associated with rail transit ridership. We also found that station-level accessibility is as important as land use for explaining rail transit ridership levels. Finally, we conclude that development density and station-level accessibility measures such as the number of station entrances or exits and the number of bus routes at the station are the most important and consistent factors for promoting rail transit ridership.},

These models estimate the number of passengers boarding at each station as a function of the station characteristics and the areas that they serve. These models have considerable advantages over the traditional four-step model, including simplicity of use, easy interpretation of results, immediate response and low cost. Nevertheless, the models usually use traditional ordinary least squares (OLS) multiple regression, which assume parametric stability. This study proposes a direct model that uses geographically weighted regression (GWR) to forecast boarding at the Madrid Metro stations. Here, the results obtained using the OLS and GWR models are compared. The GWR model results in a better fit than the traditional one. In addition, the information supplied by the GWR model regarding the spatial variation of elasticities and their statistical significance provides more realistic and useful results. ?? 2012 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {This article develops a rapid response ridership forecast model, based on the combined use of Geographic Information Systems (GIS), distance-decay functions and multiple regression models. The number of passengers boarding at each station in the Madrid Metro network is estimated as a function of the characteristics of the stations (type, number of lines, accessibility within the network, etc.) and of the areas they serve (population and employment characteristics, land-use mix, street density, presence of feeder modes, etc.). The paper considers the need to evaluate the distance threshold used (not the choice of a fixed distance threshold by assimilation from other studies), the distance calculation procedure (network distance versus straight-line distance) and, above all, the use of distance-decay weighted regression (so that the data from the bands nearer the stations have a greater weighting in the model than those farther away). Analyses carried out show that weighting the variables according to the distance-decay functions provides systematically better results. The choice of distance threshold also significantly improves outcomes. When an all-or-nothing function is used, the way the service area is calculated (straight-line or network distances) does not seem to have a decisive influence on the results. However, it seems to be more influential when distance-decay weighting is used. ?? 2011 Elsevier Ltd.},

Shortcomings of previous research:
1. Proposed models use standard distance thresholds for delimiting service areas and do not take into account that the greater the distance to stops and stations within the catchment area, the less public transport tends to be used.

abstract = {Background Obesity is a major health problem in the United States and around the world. To date, relationships between obesity and aspects of the built environment have not been evaluated empirically at the individual level. Objective To evaluate the relationship between the built environment around each participant's place of residence and self-reported travel patterns (walking and time in a car), body mass index (BMI), and obesity for specific gender and ethnicity classifications. Methods Body Mass Index, minutes spent in a car, kilometers walked, age, income, educational attainment, and gender were derived through a travel survey of 10,878 participants in the Atlanta, Georgia region. Objective measures of land use mix, net residential density, and street connectivity were developed within a 1-kilometer network distance of each participant's place of residence. A cross-sectional design was used to associate urban form measures with obesity, BMI, and transportation-related activity when adjusting for sociodemographic covariates. Discrete analyses were conducted across gender and ethnicity. The data were collected between 2000 and 2002 and analysis was conducted in 2004. Results Land-use mix had the strongest association with obesity (BMI???30 kg/m2), with each quartile increase being associated with a 12.2{\%} reduction in the likelihood of obesity across gender and ethnicity. Each additional hour spent in a car per day was associated with a 6{\%} increase in the likelihood of obesity. Conversely, each additional kilometer walked per day was associated with a 4.8{\%} reduction in the likelihood of obesity. As a continuous measure, BMI was significantly associated with urban form for white cohorts. Relationships among urban form, walk distance, and time in a car were stronger among white than black cohorts. Conclusions Measures of the built environment and travel patterns are important predictors of obesity across gender and ethnicity, yet relationships among the built environment, travel patterns, and weight may vary across gender and ethnicity. Strategies to increase land-use mix and distance walked while reducing time in a car can be effective as health interventions. ?? 2004 American Journal of Preventive Medicine.},

This article presents a method for determining the population with walking access to bus stop locations using the spatial and aspatial attributes of parcels and the network distances from parcels to bus stop locations. This parcel-network method avoids the well-known and unrealistic assumptions associated with the existing methods and reduces overestimation of the population with access to transit, resulting in improved spatial precision and superior inputs to transit service decision-making processes. Comparisons of the parcel-network method, the buffer method, and the network-ratio method are made in a study area within the Dallas metropolitan area. The novel integration of cadastral data with network analysis in our method holds promise for research in many areas of geographic information science.},

abstract = {Access coverage is important in public transit planning, as this is the means by which service is provided to riders. In fact the proximity of demand (population and employment) to stops or stations on the network to a great extent explains its greater or lesser usage by potential users. Coverage of service areas can be delineated by GIS through the creation of buffers around transit facilities based on Euclidean (straight-line) distance. A second method is based on calculations of distances along a street network (network distance). The choice of the distance calculation method affects significantly the final results in terms of population covered. This paper assesses the overestimation of the straight-line-distance method, which is the most widely used in coverage analysis, by comparing it with that of network distances. It investigates systematically the factors influencing this overestimation, such as the density of stops or stations, the coverage distance thresholds and the characteristics of the area analysed (street-network design, barriers, and population distribution in the neighbourhood of the bus stop or station). Finally, it concludes that the network-distance method provides systematically better estimates of transit ridership than the Euclidean distance method.},

abstract = {In this paper we analyse the role of walking accessibility to transit facilities. Microdata and GIS tools have been used to calculate distances walked by different population groups in accessing Metro stations. Distances walked by the population were used to determine the threshold distances of the station service areas and calculate the population covered by the Metro network. With respect to Metro ridership, different distance-decay functions were adjusted and the sensitivity of the population groups to the distance was measured. Two indicators were proposed, based on the distance-decay functions, to measure access quality and potential demand. The Madrid Metro network was used as the study area. Results show that young people and adults, men, immigrants, and public transit captives are willing to walk longer distances and are less sensitive to the effect of distance. When walking distances have been used in order to fix the limit of catchment areas, the amount of the population covered is lower than when a standard threshold (0.5 miles) is used, but overestimations affect each age group in a different way. The access quality indicator shows that the population group in the worst situation is children and that stations in the centre of the network have higher access quality values. However, the synthetic accessibility indicator shows that potential demand is lower for the most central and most peripheral stations than for the stations located in the intermediate areas. It has been proved that both indicators are sensitive to changes in the spatial distribution of population groups within the catchment areas. These results demonstrate some of the advantages of the proposed methodology and argue in favour of its use in public transport planning.

abstract = {Generating a buffer or service area around a feature is a very basic command of a geographic information system. However, most existing methods for doing so create simple distance-bounded geometric buffers. While these methods function well for many applications, they have limitations when dealing with network-based phenomena because they do not take the geometry or impedance of the underlying network into account. More complex methods can be used to create network-based service areas. While they tend to work well on the network itself they often do not allocate off-network areas on an exclusive basis. In our case study of light rail systems, we required a set of mutually exclusive network-based buffers. To create such buffers we developed a hierarchical raster-based algorithm. It is hierarchical in the sense that the off-network distance between each cell and its nearest network segment is calculated separately from the on-network distance between each segment and its nearest node. This method allows the creation of buffers bounded by distance or travel cost with true mutual exclusivity and realistic allocation of off-network areas. ?? 2003 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Past studies show that those living near train stations tend to rail-commute far more often than the typical resident of rail-served cities. Some contend this is largely due to self- selection, marked by those with an affinity to transit riding consciously moving into neighborhoods that are well-served by transit. This article explores the self-selection question by constructing a nested logit model that jointly estimates the probability someone will reside near a rail stop and in turn commute by rail transit, using year-2000 travel data from the San Francisco Bay Area. A multinomial logit model is also used to predict car ownership levels. The research reveals that residential location and commute choice are jointly related decisions among station-area residents. A comparison of odds ratios among those living near and away from transit, controlling for the influences of other factors, suggests that residential self-selection accounts for approximately 40 percent of the rail-commute decision. These findings suggest that supportive zoning should be introduced and barriers to residential mobility should be eliminated to allow the self-selection process to occur naturally through the marketplace.},

abstract = {Public transit in the United States has depended increasingly on public subsidies since the inception of the federal mass transit assistance program in the early 1960s. The subsidies are associated with declining efficiency and labor productivity, as urban transit systems have overcapitalized, simplified fare structures, and extended service into sparse suburban markets. Despite these subsidies, transit has not proved successful in countering the effects on its market of increased automobile ownership and use and of decentralizaton of residences and places of employment.},

In order not to duplicate the literature review, the researchers focus on a relatively small number of studies, most of them completed within the last 5 years, on the ways in which "urban form" and public transportation interact. 1.1},

@article{Cervero1997,
abstract = {The built environment is thought to influence travel demand along three principal dimensions —density, diversity, and design. This paper tests this proposition by examining how the ‘3Ds' affect trip rates and mode choice of residents in the San Francisco Bay Area. Using 1990 travel diary data and land-use records obtained from the U.S. census, regional inventories, and field surveys, models are estimated that relate features of the built environment to variations in vehicle miles traveled per household and mode choice, mainly for non-work trips. Factor analysis is used to linearly combine variables into the density and design dimensions of the built environment. The research finds that density, land-use diversity, and pedestrian-oriented designs generally reduce trip rates and encourage non-auto travel in statistically significant ways, though their influences appear to be fairly marginal. Elasticities between variables and factors that capture the 3Ds and various measures of travel demand are generally in the 0.06 to 0.18 range, expressed in absolute terms. Compact development was found to exert the strongest influence on personal business trips. Within-neighborhood retail shops, on the other hand, were most strongly associated with mode choice for work trips. And while a factor capturing ‘walking quality' was only moderately related to mode choice for non-work trips, those living in neighborhoods with grid-iron street designs and restricted commercial parking were nonetheless found to average significantly less vehicle miles of travel and rely less on single-occupant vehicles for non-work trips. Overall, this research shows that the elasticities between each dimension of the built environment and travel demand are modest to moderate, though certainly not inconsequential. Thus it supports the contention of new urbanists and others that creating more compact, diverse, and pedestrian-orientated neighborhoods, in combination, can meaningfully influence how Americans travel.},

@article{Ratner2013,
abstract = {As large cities seek to expand their transit systems to accommodate increasing travel demand, provide alternatives to growing road traffic congestion, and improve accessibility, more research attention has been focused on the land use effects of transit, most notably in the form of transit-oriented development (TOD). Many cities in the USA are starting or expanding rail transit systems with objectives that include more focused economic development near transit stations and along transit corridors. Denver, Colorado is one of the cities that is aggressively expanding its rail transit system and encouraging high-density, mixed-use development in the station areas. This study analyzes TOD data from the Denver Regional Transportation District and the Denver Regional Council of Governments for 0.5-mile areas around current and proposed rail transit stations. Early evidence indicates that the scope of transit-oriented development in Denver is considerable, resulting in nearly 18,000 residential dwelling units, 5.3 million square feet of retail space, 5.4 million square feet of office space, and 6.2 million square feet of medical space within one-half mile of existing or planned transit stations from 1997 to 2010. As one of the critical elements of the regional land use and transportation plan, the rail transit system and the emphasis on transit-oriented development is contributing to an increase in the average density of the Denver urbanized area. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier Ltd.},
